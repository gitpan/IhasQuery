IhasQuery

Version 0.03

This Module aims to take the repetitiveness out of simple database activity. It delivers far less than an ORM like DBIC, but is also far simpler and easier to learn. At this time it only supports INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, SELECT, and COUNT, and it supports a WHERE clause. It is also possible to execute a string as a SQL command. Future enhancements will support a Stored Procedure interface, GROUP BY and ORDER BY. It is not intended to add support for JOIN, if that support is ever added it would be implemented as mocking a View.

IhQ is a sensible choice if you are concerned with basic SQL operations, and can move any joins out to a View or Stored Procedure. It's advantage is that it is pretty simple and is intuitive if you already know SQL.

I presume that others have written similar wrappers in the past, and in fact IhasQuery is superficially similar to Fey:SQL, but differs significantly in that it requires no predefinition (it needs a DBI handle and the name of a table, which is close enough to no predefinition) and is dumber.


INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

You may want to look at the Testing instructions. The bundled tests under t run with sqlite, but as more features are added and tests don't work properly with sqlite, additional tests will be added under the directory t2. This is done so that a reasonable set of tests can be run at install time, and more careful sysadmins can run a more exhaustive set of tests against their specific dbms installation.
